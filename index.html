  <!--
    This simple web application demonstrates Brownian motion — the random
    movement of particles suspended in a fluid.  The simulation is based
    on the mathematical model that the increments of a Brownian motion
    over a time interval are normally distributed with mean 0 and
    variance equal to the length of the interval【623170445017917†L65-L104】.
    Collisions between fast‑moving molecules impart random kicks to the
    particle, leading to an erratic path【772155142125148†L207-L214】.

    <h2>About this app</h2>
    <p>
      This simulator demonstrates <strong>Brownian motion</strong>, a fundamental
      stochastic process in physics and mathematics. Brownian motion models
      the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, and it provides
      the building block for many advanced concepts in statistical mechanics,
      probability theory and financial mathematics. Mathematically, the
      increments of a Brownian path over disjoint time intervals are
      independent and normally distributed with mean 0 and variance equal
      to the length of the interval. This property makes Brownian motion
      the continuous‑time analogue of a random walk and leads to the
      diffusion equation and Wiener process that underpin stochastic calculus.

      To explore, choose a number of simulation steps and a time increment
      Δt below, then click <em>Simulate</em>. The app will draw
      a two‑dimensional Brownian path starting from the centre of the canvas
      and report basic statistics such as the final displacement and mean
      squared displacement. By adjusting Δt and the number of
      steps, you can observe how the path becomes rougher and more widely
      spread as total time increases. This experiment highlights the
      fundamental result that the mean displacement tends to zero while
      the variance grows linearly with elapsed time.
